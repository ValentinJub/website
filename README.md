## Why building a website from A to Z?

To learn. It's not an easy task to handle all the steps of the process and oh boy there are many. Planning, searching, designing, coding, testing, deploying and hosting.

Web dev can seem simple but it combines multiple programming languages and technologies stacked. 

### The struggles of coding

The more I code the website, the more I realise that using the simplest tech is often the best, why would I need to use React when I can do as good with simple JS? Especially when my website is dead simple.

I built my skill set horizontally so far, I tried to grasp as many concepts and programming languages as I could. It helps having a good overview and understand the basic in different types of application. 

### Rant

I don't like CSS, I need to get good at it tho. 

### Plans

I'm using express-ejs to layout my HTML, however this website hosts projects that were created individually and have nothing to do with other projects. Some project sections have a semi-common themes. I want to establish a common theme for each sections of projects, the D3 section already has that common theme, the HTML&CSS also has a semi common theme and this needs to be improved upon.

I could create a layout for each project section, as I want them to have a common theme and also include the sidenav bar. 

There are 35 Individual projects minus a few that are not webapps.
