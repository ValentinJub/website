				<header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
				<p>The concept of type is very important in C++. Every variable, function argument, and function return value must have a type in order to be compiled. Also, every expression (including literal values) is implicitly given a type by the compiler before it is evaluated. Some examples of types include int to store integer values, double to store floating-point values (also known as scalar data types), or the Standard Library class <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/basic-string-class?view=msvc-170">std::basic_string</a> to store text. You can create your own type by defining a class or struct. The type specifies the amount of memory that will be allocated for the variable (or expression result), the kinds of values that may be stored in that variable, how those values (as bit patterns) are interpreted, and the operations that can be performed on it. This article contains an informal overview of the major features of the C++ type system.</p>

			<section id="Terminology" class="main-section">
				<header><h2>Terminology</h2></header>
				<p>Variable: The symbolic name of a quantity of data so that the name can be used to access the data it refers to throughout the scope of the code where it is defined. In C++, variable is generally used to refer to instances of scalar data types, whereas instances of other types are usually called objects.Object: For simplicity and consistency, this article uses the term object to refer to any instance of a class or structure, and when it is used in the general sense includes all types, even scalar variables.</p>
				<p>POD type (plain old data): This informal category of data types in C++ refers to types that are scalar (see the Fundamental types section) or are POD classes. A POD class has no static data members that aren’t also PODs, and has no user-defined constructors, user-defined destructors, or user-defined assignment operators. Also, a POD class has no virtual functions, no base class, and no private or protected non-static data members. POD types are often used for external data interchange, for example with a module written in the C language (which has POD types only).</p>
			</section>
			<section id="Specifying_variable_and_function_types" class="main-section">
				<header><h2>Specifying variable and function types</h2></header>
				<p>C++ is a strongly typed language and it is also statically-typed; every object has a type and that type never changes (not to be confused with static data objects). When you declare a variable in your code, you must either specify its type explicitly, or use the auto keyword to instruct the compiler to deduce the type from the initializer. When you declare a function in your code, you must specify the type of each argument and its return value, or void if no value is returned by the function. The exception is when you are using function templates, which allow for arguments of arbitrary types.</p>
				<p>After you first declare a variable, you cannot change its type at some later point. However, you can copy the variable’s value or a function’s return value into another variable of a different type. Such operations are called type conversions, which are sometimes necessary but are also potential sources of data loss or incorrectness.</p>
				<p>When you declare a variable of POD type, we strongly recommend you initialize it, which means to give it an initial value. Until you initialize a variable, it has a "garbage" value that consists of whatever bits happened to be in that memory location previously. This is an important aspect of C++ to remember, especially if you are coming from another language that handles initialization for you. When declaring a variable of non-POD class type, the constructor handles initialization.</p>
				<p>The following example shows some simple variable declarations with some descriptions for each. The example also shows how the compiler uses type information to allow or disallow certain subsequent operations on the variable.</p>
				<p class="code-container"><code><span class="blue">int</span> result = 0;</code><br>
					<code><span class="blue">double</span> coefficient = 10.8;</code><br><br>
					<code><span class="blue">auto</span> name = "Valentin";</code><br><br>
					<code><span class="blue">char</span> letter = 'a';</code></p>

			<section id="Fundamental_types" class="main-section" class="main-section">
				<header><h2>Fundamental types</h2></header>
				<p>Unlike some languages, C++ has no universal base type from which all other types are derived. The language includes many fundamental types, also known as built-in types. This includes numeric types such as int, double, long, bool, plus the char and wchar_t types for ASCII and UNICODE characters, respectively. Most integral fundamental types (except bool, double, wchar_t, and related types) all have unsigned versions, which modify the range of values that the variable can store. For example, an int, which stores a 32-bit signed integer, can represent a value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. An unsigned int, which is also stored as 32-bits, can store a value from 0 to 4,294,967,295. The total number of possible values in each case is the same; only the range is different.</p>
				<p>The fundamental types are recognized by the compiler, which has built-in rules that govern what operations you can perform on them, and how they can be converted to other fundamental types. For a complete list of built-in types and their size and numeric limits, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/fundamental-types-cpp?view=msvc-170">Built-in types</a>.</p>
				<p>The following illustration shows the relative sizes of the built-in types in the Microsoft C++ implementation:</p>

			<section id="The_void_type" class="main-section">
				<header><h2>The void type</h2></header>
				<p>The void type is a special type; you cannot declare a variable of type void, but you can declare a variable of type void * (pointer to void), which is sometimes necessary when allocating raw (un-typed) memory. However, pointers to void are not type-safe and generally their use is strongly discouraged in modern C++. In a function declaration, a void return value means that the function does not return a value; this is a common and acceptable use of void. While the C language required functions that have zero parameters to declare void in the parameter list, for example, fou(void), this practice is discouraged in modern C++ and should be declared fou(). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/type-conversions-and-type-safety-modern-cpp?view=msvc-170">Type Conversions and Type Safety</a>.</p>

			<section id="const_type_qualifier" class="main-section">
				<header><h2>const type qualifier</h2></header>
				<p>Any built-in or user-defined type may be qualified by the const keyword. Additionally, member functions may be const-qualified and even const-overloaded. The value of a const type cannot be modified after it is initialized.</p>
				<p class="code-container"><code><span class="blue">const double</span> Pi = 3.1415;</code><br>
					<code>Pi = 0.75 <span class="green">//Error. Cannot modify const variable</span></code></p>
				<p>The const qualifier is used extensively in function and variable declarations and "const correctness" is an important concept in C++; essentially it means to use const to guarantee, at compile time, that values are not modified unintentionally. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/const-cpp?view=msvc-170">const</a>.</p>
				<p>A const type is distinct from its non-const version; for example, const int is a distinct type from int. You can use the C++ const_cast operator on those rare occasions when you must remove const-ness from a variable. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/type-conversions-and-type-safety-modern-cpp?view=msvc-170">Type Conversions and Type Safety</a>.</p>

			<section id="string_type" class="main-section">
				<header><h2>string type</h2></header>
				<p>Strictly speaking, the C++ language has no built-in string type; char and wchar_t store single characters - you must declare an array of these types to approximate a string, adding a terminating null value (for example, ASCII '\0') to the array element one past the last valid character (also called a C-style string). C-style strings required much more code to be written or the use of external string utility library functions. But in modern C++, we have the Standard Library types std::string (for 8-bit char-type character strings) or std::wstring (for 16-bit wchar_t-type character strings). These C++ Standard Library containers can be thought of as native string types because they are part of the standard libraries that are included in any conformant C++ build environment. Simply use the <code>#include</code> directive to make these types available in your program. (If you are using MFC or ATL, the CString class is also available, but is not part of the C++ standard.) The use of null-terminated character arrays (the C-style strings previously mentioned) is strongly discouraged in modern C++.</p>

			<section id="User_defined_types" class="main-section">
				<header><h2>User defined types</h2></header>
				<p>When you define a class, struct, union, or enum, that construct is used in the rest of your code as if it were a fundamental type. It has a known size in memory, and certain rules about how it can be used apply to it for compile-time checking and, at runtime, for the life of your program. The primary differences between the fundamental built-in types and user-defined types are as follows:</p>
				<p><ul>
					<li>The compiler has no built-in knowledge of a user-defined type. It learns of the type when it first encounters the definition during the compilation process.</li>
					<li>You specify what operations can be performed on your type, and how it can be converted to other types, by defining (through overloading) the appropriate operators, either as class members or non-member functions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/function-overloading?view=msvc-170">Function Overloading</a>.</li>
